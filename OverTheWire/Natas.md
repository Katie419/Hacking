<p>
  Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.
  Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org,
  where X is the level number. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.
  All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/.
